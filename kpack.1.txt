Name
----
kpack - KnightOS cross packaging tool

Synopsis
--------
'kpack' [options] _package_ _model_

Description
-----------

Packages (or unpackages) KnightOS package archives from files on disk. You must
include a package config (_package.config_ by default) which will be read for
metadata. The _model_ directory is the root of the filesystem the package files
should be extracted to.

Options
-------

*-e, \--extract*::
	Extracts _package_ to _model_ instead of creating a package from _model_.

*-c, \--config* <config>::
	Specifies an alternate config file.

*-x, \--compressor* <compressor>::
	Specifies the compressor to use. Valid options are "pucrunch", "rle", and
	"none". The default is pucrunch.

*-s, \--sum* <checksum>::
	Specifies a checksum algorithm to use. Valid options are "crc16", "sha1",
	"md5", and "none". The default is "crc16".

Configuration
-------------

An annotated example config is distributed with kpack. See it for information on
available package config options.

Examples
--------

kpack castle.kpa ./temp::
	Reads metadata from _packages.config_ and packages ./temp into castle.kpa.
