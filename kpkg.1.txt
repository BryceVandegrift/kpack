Name
----
kpkg - KnightOS packaging tool

Synopsis
--------
'kpkg' _config_ _model_ _output_

Description
-----------

_config_ is a file explaining details about the package, such as name,
description, version, dependencies, etc. See *Configuration* below.

_model_ is a directory that represents the package model. It should be the root of
the filesystem as it would appear if your package was the only thing installed on
the system (sans kpkg metadata).

Examples
--------

kpg castle.config ./temp castle.kpg::
	Packages _castle.kpg_ with the contents of _./temp_ and the configuration
	specified by _castle.config_.
